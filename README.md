# python-binary-tree
 

Instead of normal sort function numbers.sort() ill create binary tree that will sort any numbers
- start with root number which will start sorting
- if actuall number is smaller than root number then it will be sorted to Left
- if actuall number is larger than root number then it will be sorted to right
- this will loop until all numbers are sorted, then just print all those numbers
